  ## Description
  Use this simple README generator built with node.js and markdown to create READMEs to go with any project.
  ## Installation
  Visit https://github.com/MAsuamah/read-me-generator. In the code tab of the repository, click the green code button and copy the code. Open your terminal and cd into the location you would like to clone the repository. Once there, type git clone and paste the code you copied earlier. Run the command. cd into the read-me-generator folder and run the command npm install in your terminal. This will install the appropriate node modules needed to run the program.
  ## Usage
  Once the appropriate modules are installed, run the command node index.js to start the program and fill out the prompts in the command line. Once the prompts are completed, the README will be created in the dist folder in the read-me-generator folder root. You can now navigate to the dist folder and open the README.md file to see the generated README.
