# Read Me Generator

Use this simple README generator built with node.js and markdown to quickly create READMEs to go with any project.

## How to Install

* Clone the repository onto your local machine ([How to Clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)).

* `cd` into the read-me-generator folder and run the command `npm install` in your terminal. This will install the appropriate node modules needed to run the program.

## How to Use
Once the appropriate modules are installed, run the command `node index.js` to start the program and fill out the prompts in the command line.

Once the prompts are completed, the README will be created in the dist folder in the read-me-generator folder root. You can now navigate to the dist folder and open the README.md file to see the generated README. It will look something like this:

This sample README can be found in the dist folder when the repository is first cloned. It will be replaced once you create your own README.*
